# lintboard
A simple tool to make onboarding ESLint to existing JavaScript projects easier.

### Usage:
1. Run `npx lintboard .` in the root directory of the existing JavaScript project where you have setup ESLint.
2. Open your favorite version control GUI to do a sanity check of the end result.
3. Commit to your CI process with strict tests that pass your existing codebase.
4. Profit!

PR's welcome, especially for tests at this point. Then we can fix my sloppy and likely bug-ridden approach to the task.
